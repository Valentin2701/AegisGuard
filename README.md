# AegisGuard
AegisGuard is an intelligent network security system that uses multi-agent reinforcement learning to autonomously defend networks. Unlike static firewalls, the system deploys specialized AI agents that collaborate in real-time to detect threats, dynamically reconfigure security protocols, quarantine malicious nodes and deploy adaptive honeypots.
